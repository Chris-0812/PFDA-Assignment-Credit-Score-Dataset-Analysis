🔍 Descriptive Analysis – Summarizes key characteristics of the dataset, including distributions, averages, and trends in credit scores and related financial indicators.

🩺 Diagnostic Analysis – Investigates patterns and relationships between variables (e.g., income, age, loan history) to understand the underlying factors that influence credit scores.

🤖 Predictive Analysis – Applies machine learning models to predict credit score categories based on historical data, helping to assess credit risk and make informed decisions.
